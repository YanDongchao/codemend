The files in this folder are taken from the [thonny](https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny) project by Aivar Annamaa.

See [http://thonny.cs.ut.ee/](http://thonny.cs.ut.ee/) for more information about the project.

The original software package only supports python 3. I had to take just these two files out in order to use it in python 2.
